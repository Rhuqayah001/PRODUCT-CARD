## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the layout and content
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

> ⚠️ Note: This version is not yet mobile responsive. I plan to improve that soon with media queries.

## My Process

### Built With

### What I Learned

- How to structure a card layout with HTML and Flexbox
- How to use :hover and :focus for button interactivity
- Styling with custom properties for better reusability

```css
.btn {
  background-color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  color: white;
  font-weight: 500;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}

Continued Development

I plan to:

Make the component fully responsive for smaller screens

Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation

Recreate this component using React for deeper practice
